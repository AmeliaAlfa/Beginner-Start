# Beginner-Start
This is my first repository in this github where at which I m going to put my small projects. If you do have any opinion or advice, feel free to tell them cause they are very appreciated.
I m still very newbie at programming and therefore, I write program in a very messy way and is really hard to understand. I hope you are fine with this :)
Will try to improve as time pass.
